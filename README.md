# i3-starter
This little script makes starting applications in i3wm work the way one would expect. It saves the current workspace, starts dmenu, executes your selected application and then moves it to the right position as soon as it appears. That way, once the new application is loaded, it will appear at its initial position (where you started dmenu), and not at the position / workspace you navigated to while it was still loading.

# How to use
Just put the script "i3-starter.py" in your ~/.i3/ directory and add this line to your config:
* coming soon *
